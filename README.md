The Denver MHA website is the one-stop online destination designed to bridge the gap between local communities who are impacted by the Energize Denver ordinance. It's a place to share best practices, exchange resources, and connect with other board members facing similar problems. The centralized platform enables members to collaborate on solutions, find vetted vendors, and stay up-to-date on policy changes. By working together, board members can create more efficient, informed, and prosperous communities.
